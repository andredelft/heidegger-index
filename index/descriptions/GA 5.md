Although most older publications refer to the page numbers of the original publication of *Holzwege*, all our references refer to pages of the *Gesamtausgabe band 5*, which also prints the original page numbers in the margin. This is also applied to the individual texts contained in the volume. (This means that [@UK], [@ZW] and [@WD] are all refered to by their pages within *GA 5*.)
